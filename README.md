# ICJ-IA2-Game
Game I made for ICT - This does not need a repo but I was bored.

Basically I made a Third person shooter game.

# DISCLAIMER
I did not make the following:

the sounds

the map

the character/weapon models/materials

basic code for: 

	AI e.g. aiming
	
	Player movement
	
	shooting
	
Title Screen

Everything else I probably made - like the shop...and the terrible camera 💀
